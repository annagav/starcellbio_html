This pathway is activated by the addition of an extracellular ligand.</p><p>Using an RNAi-based screen, you have identified five components of this pathway (<b>Proteins A-E</b>). To further characterize this pathway and determine the order of the signal transduction cascade downstream of the extracellular ligand, you test the effect of pathway activation on behavior of Proteins A-E.</p><p>A. You first test the relative protein levels of Proteins A-E before and after pathway activation. You observe that within the time frame in which your experiment is conducted, the levels of Proteins A-E do not change upon the addition of extracellular ligand.</p><p>B. You next monitor changes in the subcellular localization of Proteins A-E. To do this, you are provided with the following reagents:<p/><ol ><li>The extracellular ligand that activates this signaling pathway.</li><p/><li>Mammalian cell lines, each stably expressing a fusion protein in which Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is fused in frame to one of the five proteins (called "GFP-Protein A", "GFP-Protein B", etc.).</li><p/><li>In addition, the following stably-expressing cell lines have been provided to you as controls to assess different localization behaviors. The subcellular localization of these control proteins does not change upon pathway activation.<p/><ul><li>GFP = a mammalian cell line stably expressing GFP.</li><li>GFP-Histone H2B = a mammalian cell line stably expressing Histone H2B (a component of the nucleosome) fused to GFP.</li><li>GFP-p100 = a mammalian cell line stably expressing a protein with a molecular weight of 100 kDa (but lacking any other signal sequences) fused to GFP.</li><li>GFP-pTD = a mammalian cell line stably expressing a protein with a transmembrane domain fused to GFP.</li></ul></li></ol></p><p>C. In addition to localization, you also want to test the phosphorylation status of Proteins A-E. As the signaling pathway that you identified is new, you have not yet defined the critical phosphorylation events required for signal transduction. However, broad-based proteomic screens have identified a wide range of phosphorylation sites in each of these proteins. You are fortunate in that there is a commercially available phospho-specific antibody available for one site (out of multiple mapped sites) in each protein. These phospho-antibodies only recognize the phosphorylated form of each protein at that site, but there is no guarantee that this phosphorylation site is relevant to your signal transduction pathway. You also have an antibody against the control protein, GAPDH, which is not affected by activation of this pathway.<p/><table class="scb_s_objective_table" role=\'grid\'><thead><td role=\'columnheader\'><b>Antibodies</b></td><td role=\'columnheader\'><b>Protein Detected</b></td></td></thead><tbody><tr role=\'row\'><td>anti-phospho-protein A</td><td>Protein A phosphorylated at a specific site<br/>(endogenous protein and GFP-Protein A fusion)</td></tr><tr role=\'row\'><td>anti-phospho-protein B</td><td>Protein B phosphorylated at a specific site<br/>(endogenous protein and GFP-Protein B fusion)</td></tr><tr role=\'row\'><td>anti-phospho-protein C</td><td>Protein C phosphorylated at a specific site<br/>(endogenous protein and GFP-Protein C fusion)</td></tr><tr role=\'row\'><td>anti-phospho-protein D</td><td>Protein D phosphorylated at a specific site<br/>(endogenous protein and GFP-Protein D fusion)</td></tr><tr role=\'row\'><td>anti-phospho-protein E</td><td>Protein E phosphorylated at a specific site<br/>(endogenous protein and GFP-Protein E fusion)</td></tr><tr role=\'row\'><td>anti-GAPDH</td><td>GAPDH</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>D. Finally, working with the chemists at the Broad, you manage to obtain a small molecule inhibitor of this signal transduction pathway. This inhibitor can be used for experiments testing protein localization and phosphorylation and to order the components of this signal transduction pathway.<p/>Conduct the appropriate experiments within StarCellBio to determine the effect of pathway activation on the phosphorylation and subcellular localization of Proteins A-E. Using the results that you obtain from these experiments, answer the following questions concerning Proteins A-E and the order of the signal transduction pathway in question.</p></div>');
