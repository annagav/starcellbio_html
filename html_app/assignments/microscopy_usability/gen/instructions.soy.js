To do this, you will use an experimental technique called microscopy. Microscopy is used to study (1) the shape and morphology of the samples (cells or tissue samples), (2) protein expression, localization and/or modification, and (3) in counting the number of objects per unit volume, that otherwise cannot be observed by the normal eye.</p></div>');

  output.append('<div><h2 style=\'margin-top:0px;\' role=\'heading\'>Introduction</h2><div class=\'scb_s_mit706s13_assignment_overview\' ><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Research studies of the genetic abnormalities in one type of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer (SCLC) identified that two tumor suppressor genes (genes that protect a cell from cancer), called <i>p53</i> and <i>Rb</i>, are mutated or deleted in 90% of SCLC cases. To study the progression of SCLC, you will use a genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC (called Conditional Knockout or “Conditional KO”) in which these same two tumor suppressor genes,<i>p53</i> and <i>Rb</i>, are deleted specifically in lung cells infected by a virus that contains an enzyme Cre recombinase. Cre recombinase mediates the deletion of DNA between specific sites engineered in both alleles of the <i>p53</i> and <i>Rb</i> genes. Once both alleles (copies) of the <i>p53</i> and <i>Rb</i> genes are deleted and inactive in the infected lung cells, lung tumors that resemble SCLC develop over the next 6 – 18 months. The appearance, progression, and spread of tumors in the mouse model closely resemble human SCLC, making the mouse model of SCLC a very accurate and powerful tool in which we can study SCLC in a controlled laboratory environment.</p><p>Your summer research project is to characterize the progression of tumors, analyze the proliferation rate of tumor cells, and analyze the protein expression of a potentially key gene, Nuclear Factor I/B or Nfib, in tumors arising in the mouse model of SCLC. First, you will analyze and confirm the progression of small cell lung tumors within the mouse model of SCLC by using a commonly used histology stain, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), to analyze the visual phenotypes of the tumor cells. Then, you will determine whether the tumor cells in the mouse model of SCLC are also highly proliferative, a hallmark of human SCLC cells, by performing immunohistochemistry for a marker of all proliferating cells, Ki-67. Last, you will follow up on some recent results that identified that the DNA locus of a gene called Nuclear Factor I/B or Nfib is present in multiple copies (more than 2 copies) in tumors arising in the mouse model of SCLC. You hypothesize that Nfib may contribute to SCLC progression. To follow up on this recent result, you will determine whether you can detect high levels of Nfib protein in the tumor cells by performing immunofluorescence for Nfib.</p></div></div>');
