            <ul>
              <li>You should control for the amount of protein
              loaded within the lanes of your gel since differences
              in protein levels within your experimental conditions
              could be due to differences in the amount of protein
              loaded for the various samples. To do this, re-probe
              each blot with an antibody that detects a protein
              whose levels are not altered in response to your
              specific experimental conditions. This protein can
              serve as a loading control.
