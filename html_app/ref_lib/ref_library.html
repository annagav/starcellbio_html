              Experiments in StarCellBio generally involve treating
              either whole organisms or group of cells with various
              drugs and/or altering their growth conditions. The
              goal of a StarCellBio experiment is to determine if a
              treatment affects the whole organism or cells being
              treated. There are many ways in which a treatment can
              affect an organism or a cell. Scientists use various
              methods to diagnose the effect of a particular
              treatment on a cell/organism. Some treatments result
              in a change in morphology while others do not. A lack
              of change in morphology does not mean a treatment has
              not affected an organism or a group of cells. Some
              changes lead to internal changes within an organism
              or cells without resulting in visible changes.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              The first step is to think about the question or
              objective that you are trying to answer and then
              design a hypothesis. The user should also start to
              think about the experimental technique that will be
              best suited to analyze the samples from the
              experiment.
            </p>

              <a id="SetUp" name="SetUp"></a>2. Set Up
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              During the experiment set up step, students will
              think of the different treatments and conditions they
              would like to test on a strain or set of strains
              during a particular experiment. StarCellBio contains
              information regarding the assignment and the
              necessary background information that is required for
              a student to design, perform, and analyze experiments
              within StarCellBio.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Within StarCellBio, these are all the possible
              variables that a student will be able to specify:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>strain(s) used during an experiment. The
              instructor will provide all of the available strains
              in the software.
              </li>
              <li>available treatment(s) and their associated
              conditions. Possible treatments include drugs and/or
              media conditions to be used during the experiment.
              The instructor will provide all of the available
              treatments in the software. Each treatment has the
              following conditions associated with it:
                <p class="SCB-Normalnospacingwithtab">
                  a. concentration of treatment
                </p>
                <p class="SCB-Normalnospacingwithtab">
                  b. start of treatment
                </p>
                <p class="SCB-Normalnospacingwithtab">
                  c. duration of treatment
                </p>
                <p class="SCB-Normalwithtab">
                  d. temperature
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>time of sample collection from the start of
              treatment. The instructor will provide all of the
              possible options for collection time in the software.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              In addition to the variables mentioned above, a user
              can also treat a particular sample with multiple
              treatments in StarCellBio. These treatments can
              either be simultaneous or sequential, depending on
              the treatment start time and treatment duration
              variables selected by the user.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              At this point in the experimental design, it is
              critical for a user to set up positive and negative
              controls. A positive control is a sample in which a
              specific result is expected. A negative control is a
              sample in which no result is expected. These serve to
              demonstrate that the experiment worked as expected
              and also as comparisons to which a user can compare
              the results of the experimental samples.

              Western blotting is a technique that allows
              scientists to detect overall changes of a particular
              protein of interest in an organism or cell. These
              changes can be:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>changes in protein concentration.
              </li>
              <li>addition or subtraction of small chemical
              modifications to a protein that can alter its
              behavior.

            </ol>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Proteins are the workhorses of a cell. Proteins are
              tightly regulated by changes in the environment so
              that they are only “expressed” (present) or can only
              be “activated” at the right time and place. Proteins
              are regulated by altering their concentration in the
              cell and/or by adding a chemical modification to the
              protein that “activates” or “deactivates” it. Either
              or both of these types of protein regulation can
              occur for a given protein.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Any particular process in a cell is controlled by the
              action of many proteins which form complex regulatory
              networks with some “activating” and others
              “repressing” the expression or activity of other
              proteins within the pathway. In addition, most
              proteins are involved in more than one cellular
              process, so the whole system looks like an
              interconnected network of protein pathways. This
              means that often times a particular treatment will
              result in a change in the amount of a protein or a
              change in the activity of a particular protein that
              is important for a specific cellular process. For
              example, carcinogens often cause alterations or
              mutation in DNA sequence, which can have detrimental
              effects on an organism in the long run. When you
              treat cells with carcinogens, cells increase the
              production of proteins that help them deal with the
              damage incurred by the treatment. In addition, cells
              will also suppress the production of proteins
              involved in promoting growth and cell division to
              allow for the repair of the damage before cell
              division, and therefore propagation of the damage to
              the next generation can take place. One can diagnose
              what type of cellular response the cells are
              experiencing after treating them with a carcinogen by
              looking at (1) how the overall concentration of a
              particular protein involve in repair or cell
              division, for example, changes after treatment and/or
              (2) how the particular concentration of the activated
              or deactivated form of such said proteins changes
              after treatment.

            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Once an experiment is run and the samples are
              collected, the samples need to be prepared in a
              specific way to analyze the proteins within the
              sample. Once a sample has been prepared for analysis
              it is called a lysate.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              To analyze the proteins within your sample by western
              blotting, you first need to prepare your lysates.
              Lysates can be prepared from whole tissue (made of
              cells as well as connective materials, etc.) or
              cells. If tissue is being used, then the tissue first
              needs to be broken down in a mechanical manner by
              cutting or crushing the sample. The sample can then
              be processed using different combinations of salts
              and detergents to isolate the proteins. In addition,
              the sample preparation is usually performed in the
              cold to prevent the proteins from being degraded or
              denatured (un-folded). Enzymes can also be added to
              the lysate preparation to prevent proteins from being
              digested or chemically modified by other enzymes
              contained within cells.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Proteins are found within several cell compartments:
              the cytoplasm, the nucleus or embedded within a
              membrane (either surrounding the cell or an internal
              membrane that surrounds an organelle within the
              cell). Depending on where a particular protein is
              located within the cell, different conditions will
              need to be applied to isolate the protein(s) of
              interest. All protein preparation protocols involve
              using detergents and/or salts of various strengths.
              Detergents cause the membrane that surrounds and
              protects the cell to fall apart, providing access to
              the proteins within the cell. Depending on where the
              proteins that the researcher is studying are
              localized within the cell, the researcher will use
              either weak or strong detergent to break apart only
              the outer membrane or all the membranes within a
              cell.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              There are several different types of protein samples
              that a researcher can prepare:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>One type of lysate sample is called a whole cell
              lysate because it contains all proteins that are
              located in a cell.
              </li>
              <li>Another type of lysate that a researcher may want
              to prepare is a nuclear &amp; cytoplasmic lysate. In
              this type of lysate preparation, the researcher uses
              increasing concentrations of detergent to first
              isolate proteins that are found in the cytoplasm and
              then a stronger detergent to isolate proteins that
              are found in the nucleus. The researcher will end up
              with two samples: one will contain all of the
              proteins from the nucleus and the other will contain
              all the cytoplasmic proteins.
              </li>
              <li>A third type of protein sample is called an
              immunoprecipitate or IP. In some experiments, a
              researcher will want to determine whether a
              particular protein is associated with another protein
              (proteins often time found large complexes –
              sometimes binding to a complex is the direct result
              of a particular cellular event and can alter the
              properties of a particular protein). In this
              experiment, the researcher would first isolate, or
              immunoprecipitate (IP) a specific protein, along with
              anything else it is bound to, from the lysate. To do
              this, the researcher will use an antibody that will
              bind and isolate the protein from the lysate sample
              (see the Blotting section for information about
              antibodies). Then in later steps of the western
              blotting procedure, the researcher will probe whether
              this protein is associated with another protein of
              interest.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Once the protein sample is prepared – either whole
              cell, cytoplasmic/nuclear fractionations, or IP – the
              amount of total protein that is in each sample should
              be quantified. In particular experiments, it is
              critical to do a western blot with the same amount of
              total protein in each sample in order to draw
              conclusions from the experiment. This is extremely
              important in experiments that are trying to determine
              whether a particular treatment has an effect on the
              amount of a protein in a sample. StarCellBio
              currently has the functionality to make whole cell as
              well as cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionations. The
              capability to make immunoprecipitates will be added
              in the future.

              Now the samples are ready to be prepared to load in
              the polyacrylamide gel. The appropriate amount of
              protein is mixed in a specific buffer, and a dye
              (blue color) is added to the mixture of lysate and
              buffer. The dye will help the researcher visualize
              the protein mixture in the gel, prior to and during
              movement of proteins through the gel. It is important
              to note that the dye does not actually bind to the
              proteins; instead, it provides a visual sense of
              where the protein mixture front is within the clear
              polyacrylamide gel. If a denaturing gel is being
              used, then a chemical to denature the proteins is
              also added and the samples are heated at 95 ºC for 5
              minutes prior to being loaded in the gel’s well.

              Proteins are separated by size and shape by applying
              an electric field to them in a “gel”. The word, gel,
              refers to a mesh-like matrix made of an acrylamide
              polymer through which different proteins will travel
              at different speeds depending on their size and shape
              (once the electric field is applied).
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              The gel itself is created by pouring a solution of a
              chemical, acrylamide, at a specific concentration
              into a framework that is provided by two vertical
              plates. Under the appropriate treatment conditions,
              the acrylamide will polymerize to form a solid,
              mesh-like matrix that is only 1-2 millimeters thick.
              The polymerized acrylamide is now called
              polyacrylamide.

              Depending on the size of the protein of interest, the
              concentration of acrylamide can be adjusted, usually
              in the range of 6-15%. Lower gel concentrations
              result in large holes in the matrix and are used to
              obtain good separation of large proteins. In
              contrast, high concentrations result in the creation
              of small holes and crevices through which small
              proteins can travel and are used to obtain good
              separation of small proteins (Figure 1). In
              StarCellBio, users may have the option of selecting
              10%, 12% or 15% acrylamide.

              prior to the application of an electric field. In
              StarCellBio, the gels have 15 wells, and one well

              contains a very strong negatively charged detergent
              (SDS) that causes the proteins to be denatured (lose
              their three-dimensional shape) and also coats the
              proteins with a negative charge. A denaturing gel
              separates proteins based solely on size.

              Benchfly.com has a great video resource on preparing
              gels. In particular, the video details how to pour an
              acrylamide gel and set up the gel for running. The

              There are two additional notes to make about this
              video:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>This video will provide you with a visual of what
              the gel actually looks like. The gel is a
              polyacrylamide gel. The names of the other chemicals
              (TEMED, etc.) mentioned are used to solidify the gel
              and the names of each of the chemicals are not
              relevant for our purposes.
              </li>
              <li>In the description above, we have not described
              the two layers (upper and lower) that are contained
              within the gel. Because the goal of running the gel
              is to separate proteins based on size (and sometimes
              also shape), you need to have the proteins enter the
              gel at the same time. However, the well that holds
              the protein prior to the application of the electric
              field is relatively tall. As a result, we use gels
              with two layers. The sole purpose of this is to
              ensure that all of the proteins contained in the well
              enter the lower portion of the gel at the same time.
              </li>

              Once the gel has solidified, it is placed in a
              transparent box surrounded by a liquid buffer, which
              will help conduct the electric field once it is
              applied. Each of the samples can now be pipetted into
              a well in the gel. Once all of the samples of
              interest are added to their own individual wells, the
              gel is ready to run.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              In StarCellBio, all of the samples are loaded into
              the gel for the user. Users can organize their
              samples into by dragging and dropping the samples in
              the Samples Window into the particular order in which
              they should appear in the gel.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              In order to determine the actual size of a protein,
              we always run a sample that is composed of proteins
              of known sizes in one of the gel’s wells. We refer to
              this sample as a protein marker or ladder and it
              usually consists of a wide range of protein sizes,
              from approximately 10-250 kDa. Kilodaltons (kDa) is
              the term of measurement for the molecular weight of
              proteins.

              Benchfly.com has a great video resource on loading a
              gel. In particular, the video provides a nice visual
              of the wells and how they hold the protein sample
              prior to applying the electric field. The link is:

              To separate the proteins in the gel, a uniform
              electric field (usually around 120-200V for about an
              hour) is applied. The electric field is applied in
              such a way that proteins will be drawn into the gel
              and will travel through the gel at various speeds
              depending on their size and shape. For the first
              iteration of StarCellBio, the protein samples are
              denatured, which means that the proteins are no
              longer found in their natural shape in which they are
              found inside a cell. Instead, they are in a linear
              form and they will be separated in the gel only by
              size, and not by shape or charge.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              If multiple samples have been loaded into separate
              wells in the gel, then each sample will run in a
              parallel fashion in their individual lanes. A “lane”
              refers to the physical vertical space that is located
              beneath the well. Larger proteins will take longer to
              run through the gel and as a result will remain
              closer to the starting point (the wells) of the gel.
              Smaller proteins will be able to squeeze and move
              through the gel matrix much more easily and will
              travel farther through the gel matrix. As a result,
              smaller proteins will move closer to the bottom of
              the gel (farther away from the wells). Proteins in
              different lanes that travel the same distance will be
              approximately the same size.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Depending on the proteins of interest that are being
              examined, the electric field will need to be shut off
              after different lengths of time for different
              experiments. There are two visual indicators to alert
              the researcher to when the electric field should be
              turned off.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The protein samples all contain a blue dye (see
              <a href="#SamplePreparation">sample preparation</a>).
              This blue dye travels through the gel at the same
              rate as the smallest proteins. When the dye front
              gets to the bottom of the gel, this indicates to the
              researcher that the smallest proteins in each sample
              will be running off of the gel and into the buffer
              (lost forever!).
              </li>
              <li>The protein ladder creates samples of known sizes
              that are all marked in various patterns and/or
              colors. Unlike the proteins in a researcher’s samples
              that are not dyed, the proteins in the protein ladder
              are visually apparent. The protein ladder can be used
              as a visual guide to tell the researcher where
              proteins of specific sizes are present in the gel as
              the gel is running.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              If the researcher would like to visualize ALL the
              proteins in the gel, and not a specific protein of
              interest, then the gel can be stained at this point
              with a dye that will bind all proteins in a
              non-specific manner. The dye that is most commonly
              used is Coomassie blue, which dyes all of the
              proteins in the gel blue (Figure 2). It is important
              to note that the stain binds all proteins in a
              non-specific manner and as a result, a researcher
              cannot tell at which proteins he/she is looking. This
              step is not always necessary and it is often skipped
              during a western blotting experiment. Up to this
              point, this procedure can be called just “gel
              electrophoresis”. It is the detection of specific
              proteins of interest that is at the heart of a
              western blot. StarCellBio does not currently have the
              capability of performing Coomassie blue staining, but
              it will be added in the future.

              Coomassie blue staining is used to visualize all of

            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              In this step, the proteins are transferred from the
              gel to a membrane. After the gel has run for an
              appropriate length of time to allow for proteins to
              separate sufficiently on the gel, the electric field
              is turned off. At this point, although you can’t see
              all the proteins, all of the proteins in a given
              sample are separated based on their size and are
              present at different places in the gel. We then
              immobilize the proteins by transferring them from the
              gel to a membrane. We do this for three reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The gel is very thin and fragile and will not
              hold up well to further manipulations.
              </li>
              <li>The proteins are contained within the gel, and
              are not accessible to detection by antibodies, which
              is the next step of the experiment. Once the proteins
              are transferred to a membrane, the proteins will be
              localized on the surface of the membrane and they
              will be accessible to antibody detection.
              </li>
              <li>The proteins are not immobilized in the gel.
              Although the electric field is no longer applied,
              proteins will continue to slowly diffuse through the
              gel, and the diffusion will no longer be in a
              specific direction. As a result, we cannot use
              proteins in the gel to differentiate between proteins
              of different sizes.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              To transfer the proteins from the gel to the
              membrane, we set up a “sandwich” in which the gel is
              placed next to a membrane and protected by filter
              paper and sponges. The membrane is a type of
              cellulose (looks like a thick, flexible and
              impermeable piece of paper) and is usually made up of
              nitrocellulose or PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride).
              The sandwich is placed in a box and again surrounded
              by a liquid buffer that will help to conduct the
              electric field.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Once the transfer apparatus or “sandwich” is
              assembled, we again utilize an electric field to pull
              the proteins from the gel and onto the membrane. The
              proteins are still negatively charged from the use of
              the strong detergent in the sample preparation and
              gel running steps. As a result, the proteins will
              migrate out of the gel and move toward the positive
              charge and, due to the membrane’s properties, the
              proteins will “stick” to the surface of the membrane.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              This step can either occur at room temperature for
              approximately an hour at around 100 V or can be done
              overnight at 4 ºC at 20-30 V.

              Following the transfer of the proteins from the gel
              to the membrane, we are now ready to detect a
              specific protein(s) of interest that is bound to the
              membrane. In this step, we probe, or “blot”, the
              membrane for our protein of interest using
              antibodies. Antibodies are naturally made by our
              immune systems in response to infection to
              specifically bind proteins directly. Foreign invaders
              contain proteins that are not recognized by our
              bodies as our own. The immune system then uses the
              foreign proteins to produce antibodies that recognize
              them and therefore will recognize the same foreign
              agent in other cells within our bodies in a current
              and future infection. Researchers utilize this
              natural process to isolate antibodies that
              specifically recognize proteins of interest.
              Companies now make antibodies commercially available
              and can isolate antibodies that specifically bind a
              protein of interest.
            </p>
            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              Antibodies are a Y-shaped protein (Figure 3). The
              tips of the two “arms” of the Y structure vary
              between antibodies and specifically recognize and
              bind different proteins. The “stem” portion of the Y
              structure is the same between antibodies of the same
              organism. All antibodies made in a particular
              organism, for example, will have a similar stem
              structure.

            <p class="SCB-Normal">
              To detect proteins on the membrane, we use multiple
              steps designed to specifically recognize and bind a
              protein of interest and then amplify this detection
              through a second detection step and a chemical
              reaction, which allows the visualization of protein
              of interest.

              Alternatively, the secondary antibody can be bound to

              The multiple steps of blotting the membrane to detect
              proteins using antibodies are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The membrane is washed with a “blocking” solution
              that is designed to block non-specific binding of an
              antibody to the membrane or proteins. Although
              antibodies will bind specific proteins tightly, then
              can also bind nonspecific proteins weakly. The
              blocking solution will prevent weak nonspecific
              binding.
              </li>
              <li>The membrane is incubated in a dilute solution of
              the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">primary
              antibody</span>. The first (primary) antibody will
              specifically bind to target proteins that are bound
              on the membrane.
              </li>
              <li>The membrane is then washed in a very low
              concentration of detergent to remove any weakly bound
              or non-specifically bound antibody to the membrane or
              the proteins bound to it that were not successfully

              After blotting the membrane with primary and
              secondary antibodies, the blot is now ready to be
              exposed to film to detect the protein of interest.
              The secondary antibody is bound to an enzyme that
              will catalyze a chemical reaction to create a light
              signal that will be detected on film. There are two

            <ol>
              <li>To catalyze the chemical reaction to create a
              light signal, the necessary substrate of the reaction
              is added on top of the membrane. This will create a
              light signal wherever there is a secondary antibody
              bound to the primary antibody, which is bound to the
              protein of interest.

              <li>A piece of photographic film is applied to the
              membrane in a dark room to visualize the light signal
              because the light signal is not visible to the eye.
              The location of the protein will be marked by a light
              signal, which manifests itself as a dark band on the
              photographic film. The membrane will typically be
              exposed to film for a length of time that varies
              anywhere from seconds to hours. The amount of
              luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of
              protein that is present on the membrane.
              Additionally, the luminescent signal appears in the
              physical location of the protein on the membrane and
              can be used to determine the size of a protein by
              comparing its location with that of the protein
              ladder.

              bands on the membrane relative to the protein ladder

              that were present in the protein ladder. This is
              because the antibody used to detect the protein of
              interest does not also detect the proteins in the
              protein ladder (although there are cases when an
              antibody non-specifically binds to proteins in the
              protein ladder). As a result, the researcher will
              need to align the membrane with the film to determine

              Once an experiment is run and the samples are
              collected, the samples need to be prepared to analyze
              the individual cells within the sample. To analyze
              the individual cells within your sample by flow
              cytometry, you first need to prepare your samples to
              create a sample that contains only single cells, and
              not clumps of cells. Samples of cells can be prepared
              from whole tissue (made of cells as well as
              connective materials, etc.) or cells growing in
              tissue culture. If whole tissue is being used, then
              the tissue first needs to be broken down in a
              mechanical manner by cutting or crushing the sample.
              The sample can then be processed using different
              combinations of enzymes to dissociate the cells
              within the sample. If tissue culture cells are being
              used, then the cells simply need to be removed from
              the tissue culture plate and dissociated to create an
              individual cell suspension. In addition, further
              sample preparation is usually performed in the cold
              to prevent the continued cellular processes that may
              confound the analysis.

              Depending on the particular flow cytometry analysis

              To analyze cell viability within a population, the

              A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">secondary
              antibody</span><a href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> is
              an antibody that recognizes the primary antibody.
              More specifically, it recognizes the stem portion of
              the antibody. If you use a secondary antibody that
              does not recognize and bind to the primary antibody,
              then a fluorescent signal will not be detected by the
              flow cytometer at the end of the experiment because
              the primary antibody is not fluorescent by itself.
              The secondary antibody that is used in a flow
              cytometry experiment is bound to a fluorescent
              molecule, or fluorophore, that produces a light
              signal when excited at the correct wavelength of
              light by a laser in the flow cytometer. This light
              signal can be detected by the flow cytometer.

              The multiple steps of detecting proteins and/or
              modifications using antibodies are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The cells are first washed with a “blocking”
              solution that is designed to block the non-specific
              binding of an antibody to the protein of interest.
              Although antibodies will bind specific proteins
              tightly, then can also bind non-specific proteins
              weakly. The blocking solution will prevent weak
              non-specific binding.
              </li>
              <li>The cells are incubated in a dilute solution of
              the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">primary
              antibody</span>. The first (primary) antibody will
              specifically bind to target proteins that are located
              on the cell surface or inside the cell.
              </li>
              <li>The cells are then gently washed in buffer alone,
              not containing any antibodies, to remove any weakly
              or non-specifically bound antibody to the protein of
              interest. Any primary antibody that is tightly bound
              to the protein of interest will remain.
              </li>
              <li>A second antibody incubation step is performed in
              which the cells are incubated in a dilute solution of
              the secondary antibody. The secondary antibody will
              specifically bind the primary antibody. The
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">secondary
              antibody</span> is also bound to a fluorescent
              molecule, or fluorophore, that will be used to detect
              the protein. Many secondary antibodies can bind to
              each primary antibody, which serves to amplify the
              fluorescent light signal that will be detected by the
              flow cytometer following excitation by the laser
              light.
              </li>
              <li>The cells are then gently washed in buffer alone
              to remove any weakly or non-specifically bound
              antibody to the protein of interest. The antibodies
              that are tightly bound will remain.

              Following these steps, the cells are now ready to be
              run through the flow cytometer to detect and analyze
              the protein of interest.

              suspension of individual cells is placed in the
              machine. The flow cytometer aspirates the solution of
              cells and draws the cells into the machine in such a
              way that the cells form a single line within a stream
              of liquid. In this manner, each cell within the
              suspension can be analyzed independently.

              At a particular point in the machine, each cell will
              pass through a laser beam. Additionally, if the
              researcher is using fluorescent dyes and/or
              fluorescently-tagged antibodies, then additional
              laser(s) with the appropriate light wavelength to
              excite the fluorescent molecule will be utilized. A
              detector within the machine will collect and report
              the amount of light that 1) is scattered in the
              forward direction (forward scatter, FSC), 2) is
              scattered to the side (side scatter, SSC), and 3)
              corresponds to the emission spectra of the
              fluorescent molecule(s), if applicable. Detectors
              will read the amount of scattered light and the
              amount of fluorescence detected for each cell, which
              is then translated into a single data point on the
              computer. The first two types of data, FSC and SSC,
              are utilized to determine the size, shape and
              complexity of each cell (Analysis A above), while the
              third type of data is used for Analyses B and C.

              provides stability to the structure during the
              cutting process. µM-thin sections of the
              paraffin-embedded tissue are then cut and adhered to
              slides. The slides of the unstained, cut tissue

              Antibodies are naturally made by our immune systems
              in response to infection to specifically bind
              proteins directly. Foreign invaders contain proteins
              that are not recognized by our bodies as our own. The
              immune system then uses the foreign proteins to
              produce antibodies that recognize them and therefore
              will recognize the same foreign agent in other cells
              within our bodies in a current and future infection.
              Researchers utilize this natural process to isolate
              antibodies that specifically recognize proteins of
              interest. Antibodies are now commercially available
              and companies can isolate antibodies that
              specifically bind a protein of interest.
